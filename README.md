# Personalized Poem Generator âœ¨ðŸ”®

This is a repository for the final project of UNCC's ITCS 4111 - Natural Language Processing Class. This project makes use of the [Gutenberg Poetry Corpus](https://github.com/aparrish/gutenberg-poetry-corpus) because it provides sufficient data to create a robust model.

## The Goal
The goal for this final project is to train a model to generate personalized poems given a person's basic information, like name, age and gender, favorite color, favorite food, etc... The end product will be a command-line application that will take basic user information as input, and generates a poem as the output.

We are going to develop a Machine-in-the-loop system that assists in the generation of poetic language. The purpose of such a system is to help writers combat the obstacles of writers block and optimize poem creation by suggesting effective word choices while letting the writer have the ultimate choice of which word will come next.

### Current Dependencies
Here is a list of the current pip packages required to run this program:
